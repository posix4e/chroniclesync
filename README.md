# ChronicleSync

Sync stuff across browsers

## Features

- **Offline-First**: Continue working without internet connection with automatic background sync
- **Not Secure**: I'm to lazy and the models suck too much for local encryption, but it's coming.
- **Multiplatform**: Now with iOS support through our Safari extension!
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Health monitoring and administrative dashboard
