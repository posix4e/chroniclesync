# ChronicleSync

Sync browsing history and summaries across browsers

## Features

- **Offline-First**: Continue working without internet connection with automatic background sync
- **Privacy-Focused**: Only syncs summaries and history information, never stores or syncs full page content
- **Efficient Search**: Search through summaries and history information, not full content
- **Not Secure**: I'm to lazy and the models suck too much for local encryption, but it's coming.
- **Multiplatform**: Now with iOS Safari extension support (beta).
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Health monitoring and administrative dashboard

- **KV Storage**: Keys are the client IDs directly
- **R2 Storage**: Keys follow the pattern `${clientId}/d` for client data
