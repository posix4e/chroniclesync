# ChronicleSync

A modern, secure IndexedDB synchronization service built with Cloudflare Workers and Pages. ChronicleSync enables seamless data synchronization across browsers and devices while maintaining robust security and offline capabilities.

## Features

- **Offline-First**: Continue working without internet connection with automatic background sync
- **Secure**: End-to-end HTTPS encryption and robust access controls
- **Chrome Extension**: Easy-to-use browser integration with dedicated window interface
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Health monitoring and administrative dashboard

## Development

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository access
- Cloudflare account for deployments
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm package manager

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chroniclesync.git
   cd chroniclesync
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd pages
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../worker
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Start frontend development server
   cd pages
   npm run dev

   # Start worker development server (in another terminal)
   cd worker
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run Tests Locally**
   ```bash
   # Run frontend tests
   cd pages
   npm run test

   # Run worker tests
   cd worker
   npm run test
   ```

### Project Structure

```
chroniclesync/
├── pages/          # Frontend React application
├── worker/         # Cloudflare Worker backend
└── extension/      # Chrome extension build output
```

### Continuous Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically handles testing, building, and deployment:

1. **On Pull Request**
   - Runs linting and unit tests
   - Builds frontend and extension
   - Creates preview deployments
   - Runs E2E tests with Playwright
   - Provides test reports and artifacts

2. **On Main Branch**
   - Performs all PR checks
   - Deploys to production
   - Includes automatic rollback if tests fail

### Testing

Say "abracadabra" to run the full test suite.

> **Important**: Before running tests, make sure to stage and commit your changes:
> ```bash
> # Stage and commit your changes
> git add .
> git commit -m "Description of your changes"
> ```

To run all tests:

```bash
# Run the automated test suite
./run_tests.sh

# This will:
# 1. Run local frontend/extension tests
# 2. Create a PR with test changes
# 3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline
# 4. Report results and artifacts
```

The process includes:

1. Run pages/extension tests:
   ```bash
   # Frontend tests and build
   cd pages && npm install && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build:extension
   ```

2. Git push the branch
   # commit your changes. Make sure to consider what should go in your gitignore.
   # push your changes so the CI runs, we are going to use those results. After all you have github tokens around.
4. Monitor CI/CD pipeline:
   # use run_tests.sh

The workflow will automatically:
- Sync with main branch
- Run all local tests
- Push changes and create/update PR
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline
- Download artifacts when complete
- Retry if tests fail

Download the latest build:
1. Go to Actions → CI/CD
2. Download `chrome-extension.zip`
3. Unzip and load in Chrome as above

### Deployment

- Frontend deploys to: `https://$BRANCH.chroniclesync.pages.dev`
- API deploys to:
  - Staging: `https://api-staging.chroniclesync.xyz`
  - Production: `https://api.chroniclesync.xyz`

> **Note**: Production deployments require approval and passing tests

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Worker with serverless architecture
