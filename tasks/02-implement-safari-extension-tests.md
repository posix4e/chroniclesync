# Task 2: Implement Safari Extension Integration Tests

## Description
Replace the placeholder test in `ChronicleSync UITests.swift` with real UI tests that verify the Safari extension functionality.

## Current Implementation (Placeholder)
```swift
// Safari extension testing would require special test infrastructure
// to launch Safari and interact with the extension
func testSafariExtensionIntegration() throws {
    // This is a placeholder for Safari extension testing
    // In a real implementation, we would need to:
    // 1. Launch Safari
    // 2. Enable the extension
    // 3. Navigate to a test page
    // 4. Verify the extension functionality
    // 5. Take screenshots at key points
    
    // For now, we'll just mark this as a success
    XCTAssert(true)
}
```

## Requirements
1. Research how to test Safari extensions in UI tests
2. Implement a proper test that:
   - Launches Safari
   - Enables the ChronicleSync extension
   - Navigates to a test page
   - Verifies the extension functionality
   - Takes screenshots at key points for documentation
3. Handle test setup and teardown properly
4. Add appropriate assertions to verify functionality

## Technical Notes
- May need to use XCUIApplication to launch Safari
- Consider using test websites or local test pages
- May need to use special permissions or entitlements for testing
- Consider using XCTest's attachment functionality for screenshots

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test launches Safari successfully
- [ ] Test enables the ChronicleSync extension
- [ ] Test navigates to a test page and verifies extension functionality
- [ ] Test takes screenshots at key points
- [ ] Test cleans up after itself (proper teardown)
- [ ] Test is reliable and doesn't produce false positives/negatives
