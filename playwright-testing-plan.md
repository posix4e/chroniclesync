# Playwright Testing Framework Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement an end-to-end testing framework using Playwright to test the application against staging environments (API server and Cloudflare Pages), with screenshot recording capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Setup Phase
- [ ] Install Playwright and required dependencies
- [ ] Configure Playwright for TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Set up test directory structure
- [ ] Configure environment variables for staging environments:
  - Staging API server URL
  - Staging Cloudflare Pages URL

### 2. Test Framework Structure
- [ ] Create base test configuration
- [ ] Implement screenshot capture utility
- [ ] Set up test reporting
- [ ] Configure CI/CD integration

### 3. Test Cases Implementation
- [ ] Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Implement page object models
- [ ] Create basic test suites:
  - Authentication flows
  - Core functionality tests
  - Visual regression tests

### 4. Screenshot Management
- [ ] Implement screenshot capture mechanism
- [ ] Set up screenshot storage and organization
- [ ] Configure visual comparison tools

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Write setup instructions
- [ ] Document test writing guidelines
- [ ] Add CI/CD integration documentation

## Technical Considerations
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for different staging environments
   - Implement configuration management for different test scenarios

2. **Screenshot Strategy**
   - Define when to capture screenshots (on failure, specific steps, etc.)
   - Implement naming convention for screenshots
   - Set up storage and cleanup strategy

3. **Code Reuse**
   - Leverage existing utilities and helpers where possible
   - Maintain consistency with current codebase structure
   - Reuse existing TypeScript types and interfaces

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we integrate with existing test reporting tools?
2. What specific test scenarios should be prioritized?
3. Are there specific visual regression testing requirements?
4. Should we implement parallel test execution?

Please review this plan and provide feedback before implementation begins.
