# ChronicleSync iOS Safari Extension

This directory contains the iOS Safari extension implementation for ChronicleSync.

## Implementation Notes

### History Sync Functionality

The `SafariWebExtensionHandler.swift` file implements the history sync functionality for the Safari extension. Here's how it works:

1. The extension receives a message with a "syncHistory" command
2. The handler attempts to access browsing history data using WKWebsiteDataStore
3. The history data is formatted and returned to the extension

### Limitations and Considerations

- **Privacy Restrictions**: iOS has strict privacy controls around browsing history. Direct access to browsing history is limited in iOS for privacy reasons.
- **WKWebsiteDataStore**: While WKWebsiteDataStore provides some access to website data, it doesn't provide direct access to the full browsing history.
- **Sample Implementation**: The current implementation includes a sample data generator for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would need to use the available APIs to access the actual browsing history data.
- **Permission Handling**: The implementation includes error handling for permission issues, but you may need to add additional permission requests in the app's Info.plist.

### Future Improvements

- Implement pagination for large history sets
- Add more robust error handling
- Implement caching to improve performance
- Add user settings for controlling history sync behavior

## Usage

To use this Safari extension:

1. Build and install the iOS app
2. Enable the Safari extension in Settings
3. Use the extension to sync browsing history

## Technical Details

The extension uses the following iOS frameworks:
- SafariServices
- WebKit
- Foundation
- os.log (for logging)

## Privacy Considerations

When implementing history sync functionality, it's important to respect user privacy:

- Only access history data when explicitly requested by the user
- Clearly communicate what data is being accessed and how it's being used
- Provide options for users to control what data is synced
- Follow Apple's privacy guidelines for Safari extensions
