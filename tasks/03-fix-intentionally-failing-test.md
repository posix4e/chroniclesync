# Task 3: Fix or Remove Intentionally Failing Test

## Description
Address the intentionally failing test in `ChronicleSync Tests.swift` that was added to verify the workflow failure detection.

## Current Implementation (Intentionally Failing)
```swift
// This test is intentionally failing to verify our workflow changes
// Comment out this test to make the workflow pass
func testIntentionallyFailing() throws {
    // This test will fail to verify our workflow changes
    XCTFail("This test is intentionally failing to verify that the workflow fails when tests fail")
}
```

## Requirements
Choose one of the following approaches:
1. Remove the test completely (already done in the UI tests)
2. Replace it with a meaningful test that actually tests functionality
3. Keep it but make it conditional based on an environment variable

## Technical Notes
- If keeping a conditional test, consider using environment variables or build configurations
- If replacing with a real test, ensure it tests actual functionality
- Update comments to reflect the purpose of the test

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI workflow passes successfully
- [ ] No intentionally failing tests remain in the codebase
- [ ] If replaced with a real test, it provides actual value
- [ ] Code is clean and well-documented
