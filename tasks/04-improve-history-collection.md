# Task 4: Improve History Collection in Safari Extension

## Description
Replace the placeholder history collection implementation in `background.js` with a more robust solution that better handles Safari iOS limitations.

## Current Implementation (Placeholder)
```javascript
// Safari iOS has limitations with history API, so we'll use a simplified approach
// We'll collect history from the tabs API instead
const tabs = await browser.tabs.query({});

const historyData = tabs.map(tab => ({
  url: tab.url,
  title: tab.title || '',
  visitTime: now,
  visitId: Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15),
  referringVisitId: '0',
  transition: 'link',
  ...systemInfo
}));
```

## Requirements
1. Research Safari iOS extension capabilities and limitations regarding history access
2. Implement a more robust history collection method that:
   - Collects more comprehensive browsing data
   - Handles Safari's limitations gracefully
   - Generates more meaningful visit IDs and referrer information
   - Properly tracks navigation transitions
3. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
4. Add appropriate logging for debugging

## Technical Notes
- Safari iOS has stricter limitations than desktop Safari
- Consider using content scripts to gather additional information
- May need to implement a custom tracking system for visit chains
- Consider privacy implications and user consent

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] History collection is more comprehensive than just current tabs
- [ ] Visit IDs and referrer information are more meaningful
- [ ] Navigation transitions are properly tracked
- [ ] Implementation handles Safari's limitations gracefully
- [ ] Code is well-documented with comments
