# ChronicleSync

Sync browsing history and summaries across browsers

## Features

- **Offline-First**: Continue working without internet connection with automatic background sync
- **Privacy-Focused**: Only syncs summaries and history information, never stores or syncs full page content
- **Efficient Search**: Search through summaries and history information, not full content
- **Not Secure**: I'm to lazy and the models suck too much for local encryption, but it's coming.
- **Not Multiplatform**: We haven't added IOS support cause basic stuff still doesn't work.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Health monitoring and administrative dashboard
