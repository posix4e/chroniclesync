ChronicleSync Safari iOS Extension Project Setup Guide
=======================================================

This script will guide you through the process of creating a Safari App Extension
project for iOS. You'll need macOS with Xcode installed to complete this process.

Steps to create a Safari iOS Extension:

1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store if you haven't already

2. Create a new Xcode project:
   - Open Xcode
   - Select "Create a new Xcode project"
   - Choose "App" under iOS
   - Name your project "ChronicleSync"
   - Select "Include Safari Extension" option

3. Configure the project:
   - Set Bundle Identifier to "xyz.chroniclesync.app"
   - Set Team to your Apple Developer account
   - Set Deployment Target to iOS 16.0 or later

4. Configure the Safari Extension:
   - In the Project Navigator, find the Safari Extension target
   - Set Bundle Identifier to "xyz.chroniclesync.app.extension"
   - Update Info.plist with appropriate extension settings

5. Import the extension files:
   - Build the Safari extension with: npm run build:safari
   - Extract safari-extension.zip
   - Copy the extracted files to the Safari Extension folder in Xcode

6. Configure extension permissions:
   - Update the extension's Info.plist with necessary permissions
   - Configure NSExtension settings for the Safari extension

7. Test the extension:
   - Build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device
   - Enable the extension in Safari settings
   - Test the extension functionality

For automated testing on iOS Safari:
- Use Appium with XCUITest driver for iOS automation
- Configure Playwright to connect to the Appium server
- Run tests against the Safari browser with the extension installed
