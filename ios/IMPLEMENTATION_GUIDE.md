# ChronicleSync iOS Safari Extension Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed information about the implementation of the ChronicleSync Safari extension for iOS.

## Overview

The ChronicleSync iOS Safari extension is built using Apple's Safari Web Extension framework, which allows developers to create extensions that work with Safari on iOS. The extension uses the WebExtension API, which is compatible with the Chrome extension API with some limitations.

## Architecture

The implementation consists of two main components:

1. **iOS App** - A container app that hosts the Safari extension
2. **Safari Extension** - The actual extension that runs in Safari

### iOS App

The iOS app is a simple SwiftUI application that provides:

- Information about the extension
- Instructions for enabling the extension
- Links to the ChronicleSync website

### Safari Extension

The Safari extension is implemented using the WebExtension API and includes:

- **Background Script** (`background.js`) - Handles history syncing and API communication
- **Content Script** (`content-script.js`) - Tracks page visits
- **Popup UI** (`popup.html`, `popup.js`) - User interface for the extension

## API Compatibility

The Safari WebExtension API is compatible with the Chrome extension API, but with some limitations:

| Feature | Chrome | Safari iOS | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| Background Scripts | Full support | Limited execution time | Safari may suspend background scripts to save battery |
| Content Scripts | Full support | Full support | Works the same as Chrome |
| Storage API | Full support | Full support | `chrome.storage` becomes `browser.storage` |
| History API | Full support | Limited access | Some methods may not be available |
| Tabs API | Full support | Limited access | Some methods may not be available |
| Native Messaging | Full support | Limited support | Uses different mechanism |

## Implementation Details

### Background Script

The background script (`background.js`) is responsible for:

1. Initializing the extension
2. Tracking browser history
3. Syncing history with the server
4. Setting up periodic sync

Key adaptations for Safari:

- Use of `browser.*` APIs instead of `chrome.*`
- Implementation of IndexedDB for local storage
- Handling of Safari-specific limitations

### Content Script

The content script (`content-script.js`) is responsible for:

1. Tracking page visits
2. Sending page information to the background script

Key adaptations for Safari:

- Use of `browser.runtime.sendMessage` instead of `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
- Handling of Safari-specific event timing

### Popup UI

The popup UI (`popup.html`, `popup.js`) provides:

1. Connection status
2. Sync controls
3. Sync statistics
4. API key configuration

Key adaptations for Safari:

- Mobile-friendly UI design
- Touch-optimized controls
- Simplified layout for smaller screens

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components of the iOS app
2. **UI Tests** - Test the user interface and capture screenshots
3. **Integration Tests** - Test the extension's interaction with the ChronicleSync API

### Screenshot Capture

The UI tests automatically capture screenshots at key points:

1. App launch
2. Extension settings
3. Extension popup

These screenshots are saved as test artifacts in the CI/CD pipeline.

## CI/CD Integration

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and includes:

1. Building the iOS app and Safari extension
2. Running unit tests
3. Running UI tests and capturing screenshots
4. Creating a self-signed IPA file
5. Uploading artifacts (IPA, screenshots, logs)

## Deployment

To deploy the extension:

1. Archive the Xcode project
2. Export the archive as an IPA file
3. Submit to the App Store using App Store Connect

## Security Considerations

The extension implements several security measures:

1. **API Key Storage** - Securely stored using the browser's storage API
2. **Data Encryption** - All data is encrypted before transmission
3. **Permission Model** - Uses the minimum required permissions
4. **Sandboxing** - Operates within Safari's extension sandbox

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Extension Not Loading** - Check Safari settings and ensure the extension is enabled
2. **Sync Failures** - Verify API key and network connectivity
3. **Performance Issues** - Check for background script limitations

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Offline Support** - Enhanced offline functionality
2. **Sync Optimization** - Reduce data usage and improve sync speed
3. **UI Enhancements** - More mobile-friendly interface
4. **Push Notifications** - Add support for sync notifications
