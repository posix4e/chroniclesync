  <h1>Test Page 2</h1>
  <p>This is the second test page for Chronicle Sync content extraction.</p>
  <p>It contains different <em>unique keywords</em> like "chroniclesync-test-marker-beta" that we can search for.</p>
  <p>This page also mentions artificial intelligence but in a different context.</p>

    <h2>Technical Section</h2>
    <p>Some technical content about web browsers and extensions.</p>
    <p>Here's another unique identifier: chroniclesync-test-id-67890</p>

    <h2>Long Text Section</h2>
    <p>This section contains a longer paragraph of text to test extraction of larger content blocks. 
    The Chronicle Sync extension should be able to extract and index this content properly for searching later.
    We'll include some specific phrases like "quantum computing paradigm" and "neural network architecture" 
    that we can search for to verify the content extraction is working correctly.</p>
