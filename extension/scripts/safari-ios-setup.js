Safari iOS Extension Setup

To fully set up a Safari iOS extension, you'll need to:

1. Install Xcode on a macOS system
2. Create a new Safari App Extension project
3. Copy the extension files from ${EXTENSION_DIR} to the Safari App Extension project
4. Configure the extension in Xcode
5. Build and test on iOS devices or simulators

For automated testing on iOS Safari:
- Use Appium with XCUITest driver for iOS automation
- Configure Playwright to connect to the Appium server
- Run tests against the Safari browser with the extension installed

For CI/CD:
- Use GitHub Actions with macOS runners
- Install Xcode and iOS simulators
- Build the Safari extension
- Run tests on iOS simulators
