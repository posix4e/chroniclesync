## Development

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository access
- Cloudflare account for deployments
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm package manager

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chroniclesync.git
   cd chroniclesync
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd pages
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../worker
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Start frontend development server
   cd pages
   npm run dev

   # Start worker development server (in another terminal)
   cd worker
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run Tests Locally**
   ```bash
   # Run frontend tests
   cd pages
   npm run test

   # Run worker tests
   cd worker
   npm run test
   ```

### Project Structure

├── pages/          # Frontend React application
├── worker/         # Cloudflare Worker backend
└── extension/      # Chrome extension build output
```

### Continuous Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically handles testing, building, and deployment:

1. **On Pull Request**
   - Runs linting and unit tests
   - Builds frontend and extension
   - Creates preview deployments
   - Runs E2E tests with Playwright
   - Provides test reports and artifacts

2. **On Main Branch**
   - Performs all PR checks
   - Deploys to production
   - Includes automatic rollback if tests fail

### Testing

After pushing changes, just run:
```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

This will:
- Watch the tests run live
- Download artifacts when done
- Show logs if anything fails

For local testing:
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd pages && npm test

# Backend tests
cd worker && npm test
```

### Extension Development

1. **Build the Extension**
   ```bash
   cd pages
   npm run build:extension
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `extension/` directory

Alternatively, download the latest build:
1. Go to Actions → CI/CD
2. Download `chrome-extension.zip`
3. Unzip and load in Chrome as above
