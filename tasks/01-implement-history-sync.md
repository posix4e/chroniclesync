# Task 1: Implement Real History Sync Functionality

## Description
Replace the placeholder implementation in `SafariWebExtensionHandler.swift` with a real implementation that interacts with the native iOS history API.

## Current Implementation (Placeholder)
```swift
// Handle syncing history
private func handleSyncHistory(context: NSExtensionContext) {
    // In a real implementation, this would interact with the native iOS history API
    // For now, we'll just return a success message
    let response = ["success": true, "message": "History sync initiated"] as [String : Any]
    respondWithMessage(message: response, context: context)
}
```

## Requirements
1. Research the iOS History API and how to access it from a Safari extension
2. Implement a proper history sync function that:
   - Retrieves browsing history from Safari
   - Formats it according to the expected data structure
   - Returns real history data instead of a placeholder success message
3. Handle potential permission issues and error cases
4. Add appropriate logging for debugging

## Technical Notes
- iOS has strict privacy controls around browsing history
- May need to use `WKWebsiteDataStore` or similar APIs
- Consider implementing pagination for large history sets
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function retrieves actual browsing history from Safari
- [ ] History data is properly formatted and returned
- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Implementation respects iOS privacy guidelines
- [ ] Code is well-documented with comments
