4. **Open PR**: Create a pull request to the main branch

Our [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) will automatically:
- Install all dependencies
- Run linting and tests
- Build the extension and web app
- Deploy preview environments
- Run E2E tests

### Development Workflow

Each pull request triggers our CI/CD pipeline which:

1. **Build & Test** ([view action](../../actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml))
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting
   - Executes unit tests
   - Builds extension and web app
   - Runs E2E tests with Playwright

2. **Preview Deployment**
   - Creates preview environment
   - Deploys frontend to: `https://$BRANCH.chroniclesync.pages.dev`
   - Deploys API to: `https://api-staging.chroniclesync.xyz`

3. **Extension Testing**
   - Builds Chrome extension
   - Uploads extension artifact
   - Runs automated tests
   - Provides test report with screenshots

### Loading the Extension

After each successful build, download the extension artifact from the [Actions tab](../../actions):
1. Find your PR's workflow run
2. Download the `chrome-extension.zip` artifact
3. Unzip and load in Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
